              About Ms. Virginia
            </h3>
            <p>
                When my son was small, I explored different educational
                philosophies and landed on Montessori. I had no idea at the time
                how this would impact my life! In 1986 I moved to Sacramento to
                become certified as a Montessori teacher.
            </p>
            <p>

                Since then, I have guided so many young children through the
                Montessori Method to become independent thinkers and
                academically prepared for a lifetime of learning. I have also
                trained countless interns, mentored fellow teachers and even
                went to China to present workshops on the Montessori Method.
            </p>
            <p>

                As a lifetime Montessorian, I utilize the philosophy developed by
                Dr. Maria Montessori as a guide to how I approach and teach
                children. Teaching children is my passion! I believe in helping
                children to always move forward in their abilities and social
                development.
            </p>
            <p>
                My focus is 2-fold: developing the skills for academic success &amp;
                developing independent thinkers with a compassion for others.
                My emphasis is on positive reinforcements and encouraging
                children to think for themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                I purchased my home in 2023 with the intention of becoming
                licensed as a Family Childcare Home and to have a Montessori
                classroom in the heart of my home. Modifications were made to
                create the perfect space for my program, both indoors and
                outside! An outside classroom component will be added in 2024. The outside
classroom will allow the children to learn about botany firsthand by growing, nurturing and
harvesting fruit, vegetables and herbs.
