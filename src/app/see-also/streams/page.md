<!-- There's some great video and podcast content available today. The content below is excellent. -->

There's a lot of AI content out there, especially after 2022-Q3. Below are some of the sources I pay attention to.

## Youtube Channels

#### Machine Learning Street Talk

[YT Channel](https://youtube.com/@MachineLearningStreetTalk?si=QX8j_STmN3acEOZ6) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/aNPkGUQtc5)

Tim Scarfe and Keith Duggar are consistently great. I'm a big fan of this channel. Limiting to only two great examples below is really a challenge since they have so much great content. (Which is also very true for every channel on this page).

### Yannic Kilcher

[YT Channel](https://youtube.com/@YannicKilcher?si=mU5ePCW3uqRxqWcj) | [Discord](https://ykilcher.com/discord) | [ykilcher.com](https://ykilcher.com)

Yannic is an extremely fun and highly insightful source of the latest Machine Learning research and trends. He also has a great Discord community. Definitely my favorite source of "ML News" and research paper discussions.

#### The Inside View

[YT Channel](https://youtube.com/@TheInsideView?si=D4SvnTL0y8hI6EAl) | [theinsideview.ai](https://theinsideview.ai)

MichaÃ«l Trazzi is fantastic and has great guests and conversations. In addition to broader topics, mosts guests are at some point prompted to talk about their AGI timelines and p-doom, which is always interesting.

Neel Nanda is a brilliant Interpretability researcher formally of Anthropic and a co-author of some amazing papers on [transformer-circuits.pub](https://transformer-circuits.pub/).

<!-- - [A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html)
- [In-context Learning and Induction Heads](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html)

He does tend to swear a little bit so if you have young children in the room, they may later begin to tell you that "everything is ðŸ¤¬ cursed" ! ðŸ˜‚ -->

## Podcasts

### Latent Space

[latent.space](https://latent.space) | Wherever you podcast

Latent Space is a great podcast about the latest developments in AI. They focus often on applied research and application development. If you're building stuff, you should listen. Swyx (on the left) is also a very intelligent and lovely guy. If you have an exciting project in the space you should talk to him.

### AXRP - The AI X-risk Research Podcast

[AXRP.net](https://axrp.net/) | Wherever you podcast

AXRP is fantastic. It has perhaps the most in-depth discussions on Alignment, with Daniel Filan and top researchers in the field.
