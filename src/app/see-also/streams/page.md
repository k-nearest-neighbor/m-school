<!-- There's some great video and podcast content available today. The content below is excellent. -->

There's a lot of content out there, especially after 2022-Q3. Below are some of the sources I pay attention to.

## Youtube Channels

#### Machine Learning Street Talk

[YT Channel](https://youtube.com/@MachineLearningStreetTalk?si=QX8j_STmN3acEOZ6) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/aNPkGUQtc5)

Tim Scarfe and Keith Duggar are consistently great. I'm a big fan of this channel. Limiting to only two great examples below is really a challenge since they have so much great content. (Which is also very true for every channel on this page).

Yannic is an extremely fun and highly insightful source of the latest Machine Learning research and trends. He also has a great Discord community. I did some work on the OpenAssistant project he organized with LAION which was a lot of fun.

#### The Inside View

[YT Channel](https://youtube.com/@TheInsideView?si=D4SvnTL0y8hI6EAl) | [theinsideview.ai](https://theinsideview.ai)

MichaÃ«l Trazzi is fantastic and has great guests and conversations. In addition to broader topics, mosts guests are at some point prompted to talk about their AGI timelines and p-doom, which is always interesting.

### Latent Space

[latent.space](https://latent.space) | Wherever you podcast

Latent Space is a great podcast about the latest developments in AI. They focus often on applied research and application development. If you're building stuff, you should listen. Swyx (on the left) is a very talented and lovely guy. If you have an exciting project in the space you should talk to him.

### AXRP - The AI X-risk Research Podcast

[AXRP.net](https://axrp.net/) | Wherever you podcast

AXRP is fantastic. It has perhaps the most in-depth discussions on Alignment, with Daniel Filan and top researchers in the field.
