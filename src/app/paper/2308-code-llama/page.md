## Summary

Meta AI introduces the **Code Llama** model family for code generation tasks based on Llama 2, and describes its development. It's released under an {% alink text="open(ish) license üëç" href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/blob/main/LICENSE" /%} and comes in **7B, 13B, 34B** variants. This model family achieves near SOTA performance on HumanEval and MBPP, and was the strongest public foundation model for code generation when it was published, **a record which was held until {% alink text="WizardCoder-Python-34B-V1.0" href="https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM" /%} shattered it** **_less than two days later._**

If you're still reading and not distracted by mention of an even newer and shinier model -- great! **There's much to learn from Code Llama and it will likely stand as a viable foundation for the foreseeable future** ... which is to say at least a few weeks lately? üòÅ It's important that Code Llama is built on Llama 2, whereas WizardLM is built on Llama 1, so many similar models will be scrambling to rebuild upon the newer Code Llama family to perform even better.
